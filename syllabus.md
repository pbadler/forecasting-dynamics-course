#### **Times and Locations**

Tuesday and Thursday, 10:30 - 11:45, Quinney Library reading room (3rd floor)

#### **Course Objectives**

The goal of this class is to provide students a basic understanding of how populations, communities, and ecosystems change through time and to provide fundamental concepts of how to forecast those changes. By the end of the semester, students will:

1. Have an appreciation of the dynamics of species, communities and ecosystem processes and the models used to represent those dynamics.

2. Understand the basic concepts of forecasting that apply across fields along with the particular challenges within ecology.

3. Have a basic understanding of working with time series data.

#### **Course Structure and Expectations**

This course will be a mixture of discussion of primary literature and hands-on experience working with data and models. About half of the class meetings will feature discussion of assigned papers; you will be expected to come to class prepared for the discussion. Students will take turns leading the discussions. The other half of the class meetings will feature computer labs involving data analysis. Most will be exercises using data I provide. I may offer an option for students to replace some of these exercises with an independent project using their own data. 

#### **Course Materials**

1)  The free online text book [Forecasting: Principles and Practice](https://www.otexts.org/fpp) 
    will be used for some class activities, but is not required

2)  All reading materials will be made available through the [course website](https://weecology.github.io/forecasting-dynamics-course/). 

3)  Laptops: On class activity days, laptops will be required for class.


#### **Grading**

60% of your grade will be based on class participation, which includes leading one discussion during the semester. 40% will be based on the computer lab exercises. Grades at the end of the course will be assigned as: A (93 to 100% of total possible points); A- (90 to 92.9%); B+ (87 to 89.9%); B (83 to 86.9%); B- (80 to 82.9%); C+ (77 to 79.9%); C (73 to 76.9%); C- (70 to 72.9%); D (60 to 69.9%); and F (<59.9%). The official USU policy is, "For work in graded courses, A shall denote exceptional performance, B above average performance, C satisfactory performance, D poor performance, and F failing performance." (http://www.usu.edu/policies/pdf/Grading.pdf).

#### **Attendance Policy**

Two days can be missed without impacts on your grade without the need to submit make-up work, though I recommend that students attempt any missed class activities on their own time because additional class activities or discussions may rely on that knowledge.

If you miss additional days, you will need to submit make-up work. Class activities can be made-up on the student's time within a week by doing the activity and submitting the code/data for instructor evaluation. Missed discussions can be made up by providing a written summary of the readings for the day(s) missed. Written summaries will involve 1-paragraph summary of the main questions and findings for each assigned paper and 1 paragraph applying the paper to how we think about either ecological dynamics or forecasting.

If a student anticipates missing more than 6 class days (i.e. 3 weeks of classes), you must talk to me beforehand.

#### **Late policy**

Unless you arrange for an extension ahead of time, you will lose 10% of the assignment's total points for each day the assignment is late.

#### **USU policies**
