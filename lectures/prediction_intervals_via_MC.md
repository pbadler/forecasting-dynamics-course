# Computing prediction intervals with Monte Carlo simulations

For time series models, and other simple linear models, the
`forecast()` function computes prediction intervals and add them to your
figure. Super easy! But don't be lulled into a false sense of security:
for many kinds of models, computing predictions intervals is a challenge.

In chapter 2 of his book, Mike Dietze introduces a useful tool for computing
your own predictions intervals: Monte Carlo simulation. He illustrates this with
a simple model of logistic population growth. Chapter 11 provides a full treatment
of uncertainty analysis.

## Logistic growth example

You can find Mike's full example [here](https://github.com/EcoForecast/EF_Activities/blob/master/Exercise_02_Logistic.Rmd) along with useful explanations of 
working with probability distributions in R. Let's just go to the key block of code 
where he shows how to account for *parameter error* in the logistic growth equation.

```
# Specify uncertainty in the parameters:
r = 1          ## Intrinsic growth rate
K = 10         ## carrying capacity
r.sd = 0.2     ## standard deviation on r
K.sd = 1.0     ## standard deviation on K

# Simulation parameters:
NE = 1000      ## Ensemble size
NT = 200       ## Time steps in each run
n0 = 0.1         ## Initial population size

# Now run the logistic growth model 1000 times, each time with slightly 
# different parameters. Store all 1000 trajectories in a matrix. 
n = matrix(n0,NE,NT)   # storage for all simulations
rE = rnorm(NE,r,r.sd)  # sample values of r
KE = rnorm(NE,K,K.sd)  # sample values of K
for(i in 1:NE){        # loop over r and K samples
  for(t in 2:NT){      # for each sample, simulate throught time
    n[i,t] = n[i,t-1] + rE[i]*n[i,t-1]*(1-n[i,t-1]/KE[i])
  }
}

# calculate the median and 95% CI limits for each time point
n.stats = apply(n,2,quantile,c(0.025,0.5,0.975))
```
And a couple of figures to visualize what we just did:
```
# plot 50 runs from the ensemble
matplot(1:NT,t(n[1:50,]),type="l",col="black",lty=1)

# plot the median
plot(1:NT,n.stats[2,],type="l",
  ylim=c(0,2*K))  # leave room on y axis for CIs
# add upper and lower CI's
lines(1:NT,n.stats[1,],col="blue",lty="dashed")
lines(1:NT,n.stats[3,], col="blue",lty="dashed")
```
## Correlated parameters

In the previous example, we assumed that $r$ and $K$ were both normally-distributed
but *independent* of each other. Often, parameters will be correlated. We can
do Monte Carlo simulations with correlated parameters by using a multivariate
distribution. 

A univariate normal distribution is defined by a single mean and variance. 
A multivariate normal distribution is defined by a vector of means and
a variance-covariance matrix. The diagonal of this matrix gives the 
variances, and the off-diagonals give the covariances between the random
variates. Here is some R code to show how this works:

```
library(mvtnorm)

my_mu = c(1,10)
my_sigma = cbind(c(1,0),c(0,5))  # no correlations
print(my_sigma)
out = rmvnorm(100,mean=my_mu,sigma=my_sigma)
plot(out)

my_sigma = cbind(c(1,2),c(2,5))  # positive correlations
print(my_sigma)
out = rmvnorm(100,mean=my_mu,sigma=my_sigma)
plot(out)

my_sigma = cbind(c(1,-2),c(-2,5))  # negative correlations
out = rmvnorm(100,mean=my_mu,sigma=my_sigma)
plot(out)
```
In linear regressions, estimates of intercepts and slopes are often
correlated. Here is an example of a Monte Carlo simulation to 
take this into account:

```
# simulate an independent variable and a response 
x = 1:100
y = 0.8*x + rnorm(length(x),0,max(x)/5)  # rnorm() adds some noise 
plot(x,y)
reg = lm(y~x)

# extract estimates of parameter means and var-cov matrix
mu = coef(reg)
sigma = vcov(reg)

# Monte Carlo simulations
NE = 100      # Ensemble size
n = matrix(NA,NE,length(x))   # storage for all simulations
coef_samples = rmvnorm(NE,mean=mu,sigma=sigma)  # sample values of coefficients
for(i in 1:NE){        # loop over r and K samples
  n[i,] = coef_samples[i,1] + coef_samples[i,2]*x   # predict values at each x
}

# calculate the median and 95% CI limits for each time point
n.stats = apply(n,2,quantile,c(0.025,0.5,0.975))

# plot the median
plot(x,y)
# add predictions, upper and lower CI's
lines(predict(reg))
lines(x,n.stats[1,],col="blue",lty="dashed")
lines(x,n.stats[3,], col="blue",lty="dashed")
```
