1. The paper includes a model to predict 1-year out forecasts of chinook salmon survival based on ocean conditions. What did the authors use for the test and training dataset?

2. Does the model include a "mechanistic" component? 

3. Given the predictive ability of the model, what do the results mean relative to the importance of the "4-Hs" to salmon survival and production?

4. What other covariates could have been included or tested?

5. How might these results be applied to conservation of the species?
