### Advice from Kylie

This is a great paper but a little long. It is long because
the authors are building a new disease transmission model on top  of an existing
population model based on extensive previous bison demography research.
You can narrow down the sections to read carefully by focusing on the the novel parts
of the model related to disease transmission. Here is a brief summary of sections 
you can skim, giving you more time to focus on the more 
important parts for discussion.

* Data page 527-529

A common way of classifying large mammals such as bison is dividing them into 
a few select age and sex groups. For this study they were divided into juveniles, 
yearling females, adult females, and non-juvenile males. Aerial counts of Yellowstone 
bison were taken four times a year. Summer counts were utilized in the analysis. 
Harvest data was also collected from bison harvested at the west and north Yellowstone 
boundaries. Seroprevalence could be determined from harvested and live captured bison. 
This process tests blood serum for an immune response to the Brucella bacteria. This 
is only an indication of exposure to brucellosis and does not indicate whether or 
not there is a current infection. This was only done on juveniles and adult females

Spend less time on the intricacies about the bison system
and more time on the details of brucellosis transmission in the second half of 
the Process Model subsection. 

### Questions

1. What four goals did managers in Yellowstone have for the bison population?

2. What five alternatives did the researchers use to assess the probability of 
attaining these goals? What assumptions were made when creating these alternatives?

3. What prediction(s) of the model were validated against test (or "out-of-sample") data?
Do you agree that the "...model could accurately represent 
the disease process"? Why weren't other portions of the model validated this way?

4. Was the forecasting effective? Do you agree with their statement that 
an action can be superior to the null even if the probability of meeting the goal 
is relatively low?

5. The paper states that their modeling framework is relevant to many 
environmental management problems. Do you agree? Can you think of examples 
where this could be used?
