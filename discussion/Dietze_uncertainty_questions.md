1. What are the main sources of uncertainty that Dietze describes? What is the 
distinction between sources of uncertainty and sources of variation?

2. Can uncertainty in initial conditions be reduced with more data? Can process error
be reduced by collecting more data?

3. Which components of uncertainty (e.g., in eq. 2.1) have the potential 
to grow through time? What implications does this have for our ability to forecast?

4. What kinds of uncertainty/variability do you think are most important in
  ecological systems?

5. If a forecast model doesn't include all of these sources of uncertainty can it be
  a valid forecast?
