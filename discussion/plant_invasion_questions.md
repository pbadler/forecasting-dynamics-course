### Invasive species spread

* Why is it difficult to forecast the potential distribution of invasive species?

* What are the downsides of using a "climate envelope" approach to model invasive species spread?

### Data and model generation

* What sources of data did they use to generate their models? 

* Why are all these sources of information necessary to address 
the question of invasive species spread? Which aspects of this question
are addressed by which sources of data?

* What data did they use to validate their model? What source of information resulted in the best model? 

### Model assumptions
