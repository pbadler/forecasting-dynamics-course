1. Why do polls taken closer to election days give more accurate predictions? 
What does that imply about the variability of the population being sampled?

2. The accuracy of Silver's forecasts depends on careful weighting of different polls.
Can you think of a similar situation in ecology, where different data sources are
given different weights?

3. Is it difficult for the general public to understand a probabilistic statement? 
(For example, Hillary Clinton has a 90% chance of winning, so there is still a 10% 
chance of losing). Do you have any ideas how to address this communication challenge?

4. Is political forecasting more vulnerable to the "black swan" problem than other
kinds of forecasts?
