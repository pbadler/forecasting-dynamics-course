1. Why do we need scenario planning? How does it complement forecasting?

2. What is the recipe for good scenario planning? Is any stage of scenario 
planning more crucial than others in your opinion? Would you add or remove anything? 

3. Scenarios in ecology
    * What kinds of ecological problems might be best tackled by scenario planning?
    * What are the implications of the examples provided for ecology and conservation?
    Can you think of others?
    * Can you think of an ecological or socio-ecological system with low uncertainty 
    that is also highly controllable?
    * Could your research or lab benefit from this approach?
