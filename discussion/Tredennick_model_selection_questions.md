### Disclaimer

This is an incomplete rough draft and some sections are rough! But I couldn't 
help assigning this since it is such a nice complement to the Breiman paper. 
Please focus your attention on the broad conceptual arguments, and feel free to 
ignore most of the statistical details. In fact, I've suggested that Andrew 
revise by removing much of the formal statistical discussion. 
The sections I think are most important are the Introduction 
(everything up through p. 9) and Examples (p. 22) to the end. 
Feel free to skim the section statistical paradigms from p. 9-22, 
but pay a little more attention to the sections on model validation 
towards the end of that section.

### Questions

1. Why are the modeling goals of exploration, understanding, and prediction incompatible? (In other words, why is it hard for one model to address more
than one of these goals?)

2. On which of these three goals has your own research focused?

3. Why does linking ecological responses to weather represent such
a difficult model selection problem? How do regularization methods used
for predictive modeling, such as ridge regression and LASSO, "side-step" 
this problem?
