1. Why is underestimating uncertainty so problematic?

2. Silver interviews an economist named Jan Hatzius, who gives three
reasons why "nobody has a clue" about economic growth. What are they?

3. Do these three challenges apply to ecology as well? Dom you think some
of the challenges are more/less serious in ecology than in economics?
