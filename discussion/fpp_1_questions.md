#### What can we forecast?

* The reading suggests that three things influence our ability to forecast:
  * how well the factors driving the response are understood
	* how much data is available
	* whether the forecast influences the thing being forecast
*Why do each of these matter?*

* Are there examples in ecology where a forecast could influence the thing being
  forecast?
  
#### Forecasting, planning, and goals

* What do we want short-term, medium-term, and long-term forecasts for in
  ecology?
    * What kinds of actual time-scales would these represent?
* How might these different "forecasting horizons" influence our approaches to
  forecasting?

#### Determining what to forecast

* What is the difference between the cross-sectional and time-series approaches?
    * What is a good example of cross-sectional forecasting in ecology?
    * What is a good example of time-series forecasting?
* Why might we forecast using a time-series only model that ignore explanatory variables?

#### Case studies

* Do any of the case studies remind you of ecological patterns or questions?
    * How complicated are the case studies compared to ecological problems?

#### Basic steps

* How well do you think our field does at each of these steps (give examples)?
