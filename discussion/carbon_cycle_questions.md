1. What is intrinsic predictability? What benefit do we gain from understanding intrinsic predictability? 

2. What are the five properties of the terrestrial C cycle that form the backbone of most models? 

3. What are the five classes of external forcing for the terrestrial C cycle? Which classes are predictable and which are not/less predictable? Which of these not/less predictable components do you think is of most concern?
