1. Why are the authors so pessimistic about forecasting? Do you share their view

2. What do they suggest we do instead? Do you agree?

3. What is the usefulness of describing current ecosystems if not in the context of 
future ecosystem management (i.e. post-hoc models vs. forecasts or scenario planning)? 
Is there any value in understanding a current ecosystem even if it will be much different 
in the near future?
