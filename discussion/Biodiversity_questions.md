### Data Related Questions
* What data sources were used for this analysis?  
* Given the "Best Practices" intent of this paper, are their choices about data acquisition more or less important?

### Modelling Questions
* Of the best practices listed in Box 1, which three did the authors identify as the most crucial and why?
* How were models evaluated (both data used for validation and tests applied)?  Which models performed best and why?  
* Why would cross sectional validation be inappropriate for this data set, and can you think of other ecological questions where it would similarly be inappropriate?
* In the discussion the authors state that, given the stability of richness in the BBS data, it would be difficult to improve from baseline models.  Do you agree? Or do you see a case for evaluating more complex models?  

### So Now What?
* While we wait for forecast skill to improve, how can we utilize poor performing forecasts or at the very least the underlying data and modeling efforts?
* The authors ran their forecasts out for 50 years for validation.  How do you think that these predictions will perform?  Did their models address long-term drivers of richness?
