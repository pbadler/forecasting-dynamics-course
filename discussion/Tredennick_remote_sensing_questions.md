1. What is the purpose of each of the four simulations run in the study (pg. 6)? 
<br><br>
2. How were the models validated? 
<br><br>
3. Mean estimates of the 5 climate effects were near zero except for one climate covariate (pptLag). These climate variables were chosen a priori by the authors. 
    * Do you think this was a good approach, or should they have looked at other climate variables to see if there were some that were better predictors of sagebrush cover? 
    * How did the study design/dataset potentially limit their ability to detect significant effects of the climate variables?
    * How might non-linear responses (e.g. thresholds) to climatic variables affect the forecast? Could these be incorporated into the model?
<br><br>
4. The authors suggest that this approach to forecasting could be applied at larger spatial scales by aggregating pixels (i.e. making the data more coarse) which could improve estimates of climate effects, however this aggregation of plant response could result in a loss of information that might offset this benefit. 
    * What do you think about this trade-off? 
    * Are there some systems in which it might be more reasonable to scale up this kind of analysis for than others?
<br><br>
5. The authors state that "the approach we have developed here fills an important gap in spatial scales between SDMs and local-scale demographic population models." (final sentence, pg. 13)
    * What is that gap?
    * Do you agree that this approach could be useful going forward?
