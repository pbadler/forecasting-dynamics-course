I chose these two papers because together they address what I consider to be one of the
most interesting questions about ecological forecasting: how much does
mechanistic understanding improve predictions? In my own work, I have been
surprised that the answer is sometimes "not much"
([for example](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12686)). 
These papers seems to tell a different story.

1. What is phenology? Both of these papers are about plants; what are examples of 
phenological events for animals?

2. As far as I can tell, Diez et al. did not validate their models against
independent data. Could they have done this? How?

3. Both papers feature a model in which temperature is a driving, independent
variable. How does the Satake et al. model differ from the Diez et al. model?

4. What data did Satake et al use to fit their models? What data do they
use to validate their models?

5. Both studies offer projections ("forecasts") of changes in phenology 
in response to long-term increases in temperatures. What assumptions 
are required to make these projections? Are the assumptions different
for the statistical approach (Diez) than the mechanistic approach 
(Satake)?
