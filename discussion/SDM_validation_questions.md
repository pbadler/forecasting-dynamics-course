### Maguire et al.

* Where do the response variables come from? Where do the climate data come from?
* How were models validated? How independent are the training and test 
data sets?
* What is the main result? Does it make you feel better or worse about using
SDMs to forecast climate change impacts?


### Blois et al.

* What are "generalized dissimilarity models"? 
    * How are they different from species distribution models? 
    * Do you think forecasting compositional similarity is as challenging 
    or as important as forecasting distributions?

* What was the main result? Does it make you feel better or worse about 
relying on space-for-time substitution to forecast climate change impacts
*at decadal scales*?
